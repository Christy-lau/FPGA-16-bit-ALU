This repository contains the code for a 16-bit ALU programmed using FPGA.

It has the inputs:
> A[15:0]
> B[15:0]
> ALUFN[5:0]

And it has the outputs:
> Z
> V
> N
> ALU[15:0]

It also contains an auto tester and a manual tester, to test the ALU's various functionalities, by utilizing ROMs and FSMs.
